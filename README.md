# YouTube-Thumbnail-Data-Collection
In 2022, I noticed a lot of the videos in the Trending section on YouTube had very bright and overly saturated thumbnails. This led me to come up with the following question: within the Trending section, is there a correlation between the properties of a video's thumbnail (average brightness, saturation, etc.) and its view count?
