# YouTube-Thumbnail-Data-Collection
In 2022, I noticed a lot of the videos in the Trending section on YouTube had very bright and overly saturated thumbnails. This led me to come up with the following question: within the Trending section, is there a correlation between the properties of a video's thumbnail (average brightness, saturation, etc.) and its view count?

Although my results were not significant (r^2 value around .15), I learned a lot about data analysis and using new Python libraries by looking at only documentation rather than watching videos. 
If I were to improve upon this project, I would avoid using arithmetic means, as they are subject to high inaccuracy when you have extremely high and low values (which is quite common for YouTube thumbnails).
